sitehammer
==========

I needed to renovate my website without altering existing URLs to previously-written content.
Other site generators use an URL structure that breaks backward compatibility with my current website.
I designed SiteHammer specifically to work around my site's existing URL structure.
It provides a set of easy-to-use shell commands intended to help administer my website.

Vision and Mission
------------------
Maintain publications on your website with virtually no administration.
SiteHammer generates a website from higher-level descriptions portably, quickly, and securely.
